# Text

:::example 0300-text-01


Text can be added with the `<a-text>` primitive:

```html
<a-text position="0 2 -2" value="Hello, A-Frame World!" align="center"></a-text>
```

You specify the text in the `value` attribute and you can position it just like any other primitive.

Color can also be specified just like in any other primitive.
